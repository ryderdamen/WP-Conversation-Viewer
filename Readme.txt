A plugin for displaying chat bubbles on your site, like in their original messaging apps.
 
== Description ==
 
Conversation Viewer is a responsive WordPress plugin for displaying chat conversations between people as if in their native apps. It allows you to write up conversations between two, or groups of more than two people, without having to take screenshots. These conversations can be easily switched into various messaging app styles. The current styles supported are:

* Facebook Messenger (the default)
* Android Messages
* iOS Texting
* WhatsApp
* Snapchat

With responsive CSS, these conversations look great on all screens, are more responsive and accessible than uploading screenshots. 
 
Markdown parsed.
